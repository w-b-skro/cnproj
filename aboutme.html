    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
<img src="am.jpg" alt="webcampicture"  class="picright">
I'm a 26 year old man who's lived in Australia, the UK and the Netherlands. I studied History (BA) and Gender Studies (MA). I have had many jobs completely unrelated to these subjects, as well as to computers, such as candle salesman, receptionist in student housing, and as a waiter in a Peruvian restaurant. (For the last one I got to wear a traditional embroidered waistcoat each evening!)<br><br> However, the jobs I enjoyed more were ones I fell into and ended up doing IT type tasks, usually because no one else wanted to. For instance, I spent a few months working in a GP's preparing it for an inspection and ended up learning how to use databases in order to fix problems with patient records (i.e. test results disappearing.) I enjoyed the challenge of problem solving and this motivated me to look further into programming as a career possibility.

<h4>What's the point of this site?</h4>

    As I learn more I'm hoping to update this site with more examples, as well as to update the site itself. As I'm still very much a beginner, I'm not hoping to wow employers or show off my skills to the internet. Rather, I want to create a record of what I'm doing to record my progress and motivate myself, as well as provide something that might be useful to other people just starting off.
    <br><br>Up to this point, I have found "back-end" coding to be more enjoyable, so hopefully this website will motivate me to continue to learn more CSS and HTML as well so that one day it might look a little less clunky!
