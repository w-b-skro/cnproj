	This role-playing game was created collaboratively as part of a CodeNation programming course. In 	many ways working collaboratively presented as much of a challenge as the coding itself, 	but it presented a valuable opportunity to learn best practices when working together. 	Something that isn't available trying to figure things out alone.<br><br>
	
	Creating a flowchart provided a visualisation of the code, which allowed for an easy 	distribution of tasks and made the overall development process much easier.

<h4>Coding<br/></h4>

    Creating an RPG was exciting after creating small programs. It allowed the group to really get excited about coding as a means of creating a narrative, (Ultimately we settled on a rather morbid extension of the Toy Story universe) rather than just example programs. <br><br>
        It also presented an enjoyable way to ways one might use basic python skills to provide a solution for various problems. For example, we wanted to implement a series of challenges where  stats of a chosen character (strength, speed &c.) would determine the outcome. This led me to investigate python dictionaries and their uses.<br><br>
        You can scroll down below to see the code in it's entirety, as well as run it in the console.

<h5>Playing!<br/></h5>


   <a href="rpgplay.png" target="_blank"><img src="rpgplay.png" alt="gameplay" class="picright"></a>
   The game is played entirely through the python console. You're presented with a number of choices and which one you pick determines the next outcome (i.e. which function comes next). This isn't a particularly exciting mechanic, but we hopefully made it slightly more enjoyable through narrative and use of ASCII images. <br><br>
   Given more time, I would have liked to have created a more involved system involving the choice of different characters. Perhaps having different narratives accessible by the choice of different characters and alterable stats. However, this would have been a more involved game. <br><br>
   I hope the example below is useful to other people just starting out in Python. Have a go and see what you think!
